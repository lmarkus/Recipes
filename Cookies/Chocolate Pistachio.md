Yield: 15 Cookies

## Ingredients

* 357g all-purpose flour
* 6g baking powder
* 2g baking soda
* 9g cornstarch
* 2g salt
* 226g butter, room temperature
* 150g brown sugar (add ¼ cup more if you want sweeter cookies)
* 100g granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 130g unsalted or raw  pistachios, coarsely chopped
* 130g semi-sweet chocolate chips


## Instructions

1. Mix Dry Ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt, then set aside.
2. Cream Butter and Sugar: In a large bowl or the base of a stand mixer, add butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar. Using an electric mixer or a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugars until creamy.
3. Add Eggs and Vanilla: One at a time, beat in the eggs and vanilla until smooth.
4. Combine Mixtures: Pour the dry mixture into the wet mixture and stir until combined well.
5. Add Mix-Ins: Add pistachios, half of the chocolate pieces, and chocolate chips. Stir until just incorporated.
6. Scoop Dough: Using a 3-tablespoon ice cream scoop, scoop the dough onto a cookie sheet and press the remaining chocolate pieces on top of the cookie balls.
7. Chill Dough: Cover the balls with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours or until the oven preheats.
8. Preheat Oven: Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
9. Prepare Baking Sheet: Remove the balls from the refrigerator and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place 5 to 6 cookie balls onto the prepared sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between each.
10. Bake Cookies: Bake for 13 to 15 minutes until lightly golden brown. If frozen bake for 16 minutes, but don’t overbake!
11. Flatten and Cool Cookies: Remove from the oven. Using oven mitts, hold the baking sheet and tap/drop it on the counter firmly a few times to make the cookies a little flatter. Let them cool for 10-20 minutes.
