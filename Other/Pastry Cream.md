# Pastry Cream

## Ingredients

* 480g (2 cups) of whole milk
* 45g (3) egg yolks
* 100g Granulated Sugar
* 35g Cornstarch
* 28g Butter
* 1g salt
* Vanilla (Either 5g of extract, or one pod)

### Optional
* 1-3g Lime zest depending on how strong you want the flavor to be.

## Instructions

Step 1. Prepare the EggMixture:

    In a mixing bowl, combine the eggs with a portion of the sugar (about a quarter of the total sugar). 
    This will make it easier to temper the eggs with the hot milk later on.

Step 2. Warm the Milk: 

    In a saucepan, combine the milk with the remaining sugar (vanilla pod, and lemon zest, if using). 
    Warm the mixture until it's about to boil.
    

Step 3. Mix the Cornstarch and Add Flavorings: 
    Dilute cornstarch in a separate bowl in about ¼ cup of milk (no need to measure), and dissolve the cornstarch, stirring it into the milk creating a slurry.  
    Add the cornstarch and a pinch of salt to the egg mixture. Mix until smooth.
    (If using, Add the vanilla extract to the mixture.)

Step 4. Temper the Eggs:

    Slowly pour a small amount of the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly. 
    (About 2 ladles worth) This process is called tempering and prevents the eggs from scrambling when introduced to the hot milk
    Continue adding the hot milk gradually until the egg mixture is warmed.

Step 5. Cook the Pastry Cream: 

    While whisking the milk, pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining hot milk.

    Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens. This will happen quickly, so be attentive.

Step 6. Add the Butter: 

    The very moment the mixture has thickened and come to a slight boil, whisk in your butter fast so it doesn’t separate, and remove the pot from the heat.

Step 7. Cool the Pastry Cream:

    Transfer the hot pastry cream to a bowl.
    Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. 
    You can then place another plastic wrap over the top of the bowl if you choose to prevent your pastry cream from absorbing and odor from the refrigerator.
    Allow the pastry cream to cool at room temperature for about an hour. 
    Then transfer it to the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours or, ideally, overnight. 
    This will give you the perfect consistency for piping into pastries or using in desserts.

Step 8. Final Touches:

    The next day, remove the plastic wrap from the pastry cream. It should be smooth and creamy.
    Give it a quick mix to smooth out any lumps. If desired, transfer the pastry cream to a pastry bag for easy piping into desserts.
