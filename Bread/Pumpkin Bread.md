## Instructions

1. Heat the WATER between 100 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit, add YEAST and a bit of sugar, and rest for 5 minutes to ensure it's foamy (activated).
1. Mix YEAST, WATER, SUGAR, SALT, OLIVE OIL, SPICES and FLOUR to form a shaggy dough.
1. Stir in CRANBERRIES and WALNUTS. Continue mixing or kneading until the flour is absorbed and the dough is cohesive.
1. MIx or hand-knead the dough by folding and pressing it into itself between 3 and 5 minutes until it becomes elastic and stretchy, indicating that the gluten has developed.
1. Use your hands to shape the dough into a round, tucking the sides under to tighten the form.
1. To proof the dough 1 hour (Or until doubled)
1. Move the dough to a flat surface, press out air pockets, and shape it into rounds.
1. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and center your oven rack.
1. Transfer the dough round(s) to a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving 5 inches of space for expansion. Dust a light flour coating on the dough for visual appeal, or leave it plain.
1. To proof the dough, cover and rest it in a warm spot until it doubles in size.
1. Use a razor blade or bread lame to score the surface.
1. Bake for 35-40 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.
1. Note: The internal temperature of fully cooked bread is approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
1. Transfer bread to a cooling grid. Cool completely before slicing and storing.
1. Store in a plastic bag or airtight container for up to 5 days at room temperature.

## Optional decoration
Use four strings to tie it into a pumpkin shape before final proofing. Dust heavily with rice flout and then score.
