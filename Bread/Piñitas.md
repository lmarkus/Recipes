## Instructions
_Notes_: If you're in a rush, skip the overnight proof. Mix all the ingredients and do a single bench proof for about one hour.

1. Make poolish with 100g Whole Wheat (Or Bread Flour), 250g milk, and the first 8g yeast. Let it ferment overnight.
2. Add the rest of the ingredients. The batter will be feel wet and sticky. Hand Knead and fold for five minutes, using as little flour as possible to prevent tearing. Use bench scraper to help fold
3. Let it rest in plastic wrap for 15 minutes. Knead for another 5 min until smooth.
4. Divide into 14 portions (~70g each portion), roll into balls.  Place them in greased circular cake pan about an inch appart (They will grow!). Cover, and let them proof until doubled in size. They should be packed together now.
5. While the bread proofs, make the syrup. Mix water and sugar, boil to 230F. Let it cool.
6. Paint with egg yolk and cream mix.
7. Bake at 355F for 20 minutes (Rotate pan halfway through)
8. Paint bread with syprup after it comes out of the oven, while hot.  Use two coats. Sprinkle with sugar.
9. Wait 15-20 minutes before eating.
