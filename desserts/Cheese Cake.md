# Traditional Cheesecake

## Important
* **EVERYTHING HAS TO BE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE**
* Don't overmix the batter. Too much air is going to make it grainy.
* Scale the recipe up/down based on the number of eggs
* Lime / Lemon can be used interchangeably in this recipe. Lime is better.

## Ingredients 

Yield: 1 9-inch Springform Pan Cake, about 1.75 inches thick

### Crust
* 280g (10oz) Dark Chocolate Oreo Cookies
* 120g (4oz)  Hazelnuts or any mixed nuts (Pecans work great too)
* 60g (2oz) Butter melted
* 30g Sugar
* 3g (1/2 tsp) Salt
  
### Filing

* 1 Tbsp Lime Zest.  (About three lemons/limes needed in total, depending on size)

Fruit sauces! 


## Instructions

### Crust
* Preheat oven to 360F 
* Prepare the mold. **Important**: Use parchment paper in your mold. It will make your life much easier.  Use one round piece for the bottom, and one circular piece for the perimeter. Use spray oil to help it stick to the mold.
See [How to prepare the mold](https://chefjeanpierre.com/recipes/dessert/chocolate-cheesecake-recipe/)
* Optional: Toast nuts slightly in a pan. It will give the crust better flavor
* Run nuts through food processor first (Until they are fine ground, but don't turn them into nut butter)
* Add cookies, sugar, salt, keep running food processor until grainy.
* Add melted butter while food processor is still runnning.  Final consistency should be like wet sand. You should be able to compact the mix.
* Pack and compact mix into prepared mold.
* Blind bake for ~12 minutes. Let it cool down completely.

### Filling
* Preheat oven to 325F
* Wrap the mold in aluminum for the bain marie to keep the water out.
* Beat the eggs ahead of time. It will make mixing easier
* Place the cream cheese in stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium-low speed until creamy and smooth, about 1 minute. Add the sugar, salt, and vanilla. Beat until the mixture is well combined and completely smooth. Stop and scrape down the bowl a few times during mixing.
* **Important** With the mixer on medium-low speed, add in the eggs **one at a time**. It will take each egg about 15~20 seconds to incorporate into the mix. (If you add them all at once, the batter will split)
* Beat the sour cream before mixing it with the other ingredients. It probably separated a bit while sitting at room temp. 
* Mix in the sour cream, lemon juice, and lemon zest until well incorporated.
* Pour into mold, and tap to make sure all the bubbles come up. Pop the bubbles to make sure the batter is smooth.
* Place mold into bain marie, bake for 90 minutes.
* After the baking time is done, turn oven off, and leave it in the oven for 2 hours.  Pull it from the water bath, and let it finish cooling down at room temperature. Place in the fridge overnight.
* Remove from the mold the next day.
