## Instructions
 
Preheat Oven to 350°F (175°C) 

### Prepare the Cake:

1. Prepare the baking sheet pan, by lining it with parchment paper, applying non-stick spray underneath and on top of the parchment. Chef's baking sheet is 12" x 17" ( 30 cm x 43 cm)
1. Mix together all dry ingredients, including the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, both sugars, and spices in a large bowl. 
1. In another bowl, whisk the eggs, oil, applesauce, vanilla, and honey until well blended. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring gently until combined. Fold in the nuts and grated carrots. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the surface evenly. 
1. Bake for about 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool completely for at least 2 to 4 hours (or more if you can).

### Prepare the Simple Syrup:

1. In a saucepan, over medium heat combine the sugar and water and stir the mixture until the sugar completely dissolves. This usually takes about 3-5 minutes.  Once the sugar is fully dissolved, remove the saucepan from the heat and allow the syrup to cool. Add the rum, or any liquor you like as much or as little as you like. 
1. Pour the cooled syrup into a clean, airtight container. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a month.

### Prepare the Cream Cheese Frosting:

1. Whip the cream cheese until smooth, then gradually add the whipping cream, whipping until soft peaks form. Add powdered sugar and vanilla, whipping until combined and slightly stiff. (set aside)
1. After the cake has cooled, place one layer at the bottom of your serving dish. Chef's Lasagna Pan is 13" x 9" x 2.5" deep (33 cm x 23 cm x 6 cm)
1. If using, brush a light layer of simple syrup on cake layer to enhance moisture. 
1. Spread half of the frosting evenly over the cake layer. Add the second layer of cake on top. Moisten it with simple syrup as well, and then finish by spreading the remaining frosting smoothly over the top. Garnish with chopped pecans. Refrigerate for a few hours (better overnight) to set before slicing and serving.
