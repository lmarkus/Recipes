# Pate a Choux
Yield 30-40

## Ingredients

* 250 g water
* 250 g Milk
* 250 g Butter
* 5 g salt
* 5 g Sugar
* 350 g Bread Flour
* 450 g Eggs

## Procedure

### STEP 1
In a saucepan, bring the water, milk, butter, salt, and sugar to
a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the sifted flour all at
once.
Place the pan back over the medium heat and cook the
pastry to dry it out, stirring constantly for 2-3 minutes. A thin
film will form o the bottom and the paste will pull away from
the pan.

### STEP 2
Transfer the dough to a mixing bowl fitted with a paddle
attachement and beat the mixture to release the steam.
Allow the mixture to cool enough so as not cook the eggs
when added.
Add eggs icrementally, scraping down the bowl as necessary
until the proper consistency is reached.

### STEP 3
Pipe using the correct tip for whichever form you need
(cream puff, eclair, paris-brest, etc).
You may freeze your choux at this point.

### STEP 4
Bake at 350F (175C) for 20 min. Without opening the oven
door, turn the oven down to 325F (160C) and bake until
cooked/dry inside, another 10-20 minutes. Don't be shy
about checking on them. You'll need to break a few open to
ensure they're dry. Let them cool completely before using.
