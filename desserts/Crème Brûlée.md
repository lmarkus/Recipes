# Crème Brûlée 

## Proportions:

* 1 Part Egg Yolk
* 1 Part Whole Milk
* 1 Part Sugar
* 5 Parts Cream
* 0.20 Parts Vanilla Extract
* 0.03 Parts Salt

## Cooking:

* Preheat oven to 200F (Make sure your oven is accurate, or get a thermometer. This recipe is very sensitive to temperature! Too low and it won't set, too high and it will curdle).
* Start by separating the egg yolks first, and weight them. (Each egg yolk will be around 18 grams depending on egg size).  Based on the actual weight of the yolks, measure out the rest of the ingredients.
* Mix all ingredients together until sugar is disolved. Mix softly so that the mix doesn't become frothy. If there's too much froth let it rest.  (Tip: Sugar can be run through a blender to make it a fine powder, so that it disolves faster).
* Strain the mix so that the final custard is super smooth.
* Pour into ramekins. Suggested: 125gr (4.5 oz) per person. Wider ramekins are better because it will cook faster, and you get more area for caramelized sugar.
* No Bain Marie Needed.  Convection Bake @ 200F  between 80 - 100 minutes, depending on ramekin size.
* After baking, let them cool completely at room temperature (~2 hours) then refrigerate (~6 hours)

## Caramelizing:

* Add a thin layer of sugar (Raw sugar is best, as it's extra crunchy, but white is ok). Use a kitchen torch to caramelize. Serve immediately.
* No torch?  Melt sugar in a pan to make caramel, pour over the ramekins.

### Scaling the recipe: 

Start with one egg yolk per person.  Scale the ingredients based on the proportions. 

If using vanilla beans instead of extract, scrape and boil them in the cream first. Let the cream cool down to room temp before starting the recipe.
