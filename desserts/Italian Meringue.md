[Source video](https://youtu.be/BAye9nrNg6A)

## Ingredients:
* 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
* 3 large eggs
* 1 cup or 216g (7.62 ounces) caster sugar
* 1/4 cup or 63g (2.22 ounces) water
* 1 teaspoon vanilla

## Directions:
1. Separate the eggs, add the cream of tar tar and whisk the white to form soft peaks.
2. Put the sugar and the water in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Wash down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush and leave unstirred until it reaches 238oF or 114oC on a candy thermometer.
3. Immediately remove from heat and with the beaters running pour in a thin stream into the egg whites.
4. Beat until cooled.  This can take a while so if using hand mixers i like to put a bowl of iced water underneath the mixing bowl to speed up the cooling process. When it is cool it will be thick smooth and glossy.
5. Add flavours and colours if desired. Note: if you want brilliant white, do not add vanilla essence as it will give a creamy tinge.
6. Spread a thick layer over the cake and use a palette knife or back of a large knife to smooth.
