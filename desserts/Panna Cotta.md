# Panna Cotta
## Ingredients
* 250g Heavy Whipping Cream
* 150g Buttermilk
* 300g Whole Milk
* 10g (5 Sheets) of Gold Leaf Gelatin (or 9g of powdered Gelatin)
* Generous pinch of salt (Didn't measure it!)
* Vanilla Bean (or 2 tsp paste)
* 100g White Chocolate  (Depends on brand. Make sure there's enough for 66g of sugar content)
* ~40g Honey (plus/minus to taste, depending on how sweet you want the cream)

## Prep
1. Bloom sheet gelatin in cold water (or powder gelatin in ~40ml of water)
2. Add milk, chocolate, sugar, honey, salt into a saucepan on medium heat
3. Scrape vanilla bean, add seeds and pods to mixture.
4. Heat to ~200F (95C), making sure chocolate has dissolved completely
5. Add bloomed gelatin to the mix, stirr until it's dissolved.
6. Add cream and buttermilk (At the end and when the mix has cooled a bit, to make sure that id doesn't curdle the milk). Stir well to make sure it's properly emulsified.
7. Pour mixture into containers. Make sure to keep stirring the mix to avoid seeds settling.  Makes 4 _generous_ portions, or 6 decent portions.
8. Refrigerate for 6 hours.
9. Serve in the container, or if plating by itself, submerge container in hot water just enough for it to come loose. (If if stays too long in the water, it begins to melt). Invert into plate.


## Extras
Berry coulis or preserves go really nice with this one, especially if they have a strong acidic touch. Complements the tartness of the buttermilk.

Other Ideas:
 I can envision serving it with just a drizzle of fudge or caramel sauce, or a dusting of cinnamon or (my favorite) cardamom.  Maybe with fresh raspberries or passion fruit? How about a little espresso to go with it?


    Fruit compote (like this passion fruit mango compote, and caramel apple compote)
    Fresh berries and other fresh fruit
    Fruit syrup (like passion fruit syrup, lychee syrup, lemon syrup, rhubarb syrup, blood orange syrup, pineapple syrup etc.)
    Fruit curds (like lemon curd, lime curd, pineapple curd, or passion fruit curd)
    Chocolate sauce
    Caramel sauce
    Whipped cream
    Chocolate shavings (from dark, milk or white chocolate)
