**NOTES** 
* All weights in grams
* Preppy Kitchen recipe creates more batter for the same size pan. It needs to be cooked 40-45 minutes
* Bon Appetit recipe melts half the chocolate, and mixes in the remaining half as chips.
* (My additions: Substitute half the salt with MSG, add a tbsp of cinammon)

## V1: Preppy Kitchen
Ref: [Preppy Kitchen Brownies](https://preppykitchen.com/brownie-recipe/#recipe)

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease an 8×8-inch baking pan with baking spray and line it with parchment paper.
2. In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter in the microwave in 20-second intervals stirring between each one until fully melted, about 2 minutes. Add the sugar and cocoa and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. Whisk in the eggs, vanilla, and salt.
3. Add the flour and chocolate chips and mix together with a spatula until just combined. Spread the batter into the prepared pan. (You can sprinkle the top with more chocolate chips, if desired.)
4. Bake for about 35 to 40 minutes, inserting a toothpick into the center to check doneness, and removing it with several moist crumbs for fudgy brownies or only a few crumbs for cakey brownies. Let the brownies cool completely in the pan before slicing.

## V2: Bon Appetit
Ref: [Bon Appetit Triple Chocolate Brownies](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/triple-chocolate-brownies)

1. Preheat oven to 375°. Lightly coat a metal 8x8" baking pan with nonstick vegetable oil spray or unsalted butter, room temperature, then line with parchment paper, leaving generous overhang on 2 sides. Lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray.
2. Whisk 62 g (½ cup) all-purpose flour, 50 g (½ cup) Dutch-process cocoa powder, and 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a small bowl to combine.
3. Combine ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter and 113 g (4 oz.) bittersweet chocolate, preferably 70%, broken into pieces, in a medium metal bowl set over a large saucepan of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not be touching water). Heat, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and smooth, about 5 minutes.
4. Whisk in 250 g (1¼ cups) granulated sugar, then add 3 large eggs one at a time, whisking very vigorously between additions. Once all eggs are incorporated, continue to whisk 1 minute more. Remove bowl from heat and whisk in 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract, then whisk in dry ingredients. Using a rubber spatula, stir in 113 g (4 oz.) semisweet chocolate chips. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth surface.
5. Bake brownies until set across top and a tester inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 27–30 minutes. Let cool in pan at least 30 minutes, preferably in refrigerator, before cutting into 12 pieces.
