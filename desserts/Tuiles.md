## Honey Tuile
_Note:_  It's basically equal parts of all ingredients. Use a small egg, and do it based on the weight of that white.

#### Ingredients

* 35g butter
* 35g honey
* 35g egg white (about 1 egg white)
* 35g all purpose flour

#### Method

1. Melt butter and honey together in a microwave
2. Add all ingredients together and mix with whisk until smooth
3. Spread on mould and bake for about 8 minutes at 160Â°C
4. Carefully remove from mould before cooled. The tuile will be soft until it cools.
