* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 cup chopped butter chilled
* 3/4 cup nuts (optional)

### Sweet Potato Filling:

* 1/2 cup softened butter
* 1 cup sugar

* 2 cups mashed Okinawan sweet potatoes (purple yams)
* 1/2 cup evaporated milk

### Haupia Topping:

* 1 (14 oz) can coconut milk
* 1 cup milk
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 cup cornstarch
* 1 cup sugar
* whipped cream (optional) topping (maybe look into making a purple sweet potato buttercream)

## Instructions

### Shortbread Crust:

* Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
* In a large bowl combine the flour, sugar, and chilled chopped butter. Chop the ingredients up using a pastry blender until it starts to have a crumbly texture.
* Pour the mixture into a 9x13 pan and evenly spread it out. Flatten the crust using either your hand or a flat object.
* Bake for 15-20 minutes.

### Sweet Potato Filling:

* Quarter and steam potatoes until tender enough to pierce a fork through.
* Peel and run through a ricer (or mash). Measure out two cups of the mashed potatoes.
* Cream the butter and sugar. Then add in the eggs and mix. Gradually mix in the mashed potatoes. Lastly add in the evaporated milk, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix well.
* Pour onto the baked crust and bake again for 30-35 minutes.

### Haupia Topping:

* Combine coconut milk, milk, water, cornstarch, and sugar. Whisk until there are no clumps and sugar particles.
* Heat it over medium heat and consistently stir until it thickens and bubbles.
* Turn off heat and let it cool for a few minutes.
* Pour onto the sweet potato filling and make sure it has spread out evenly. Let it chill in the fridge until the haupia firms up. About and hour or two.
* It is optional to top it off with whipped cream. Cut into square pieces and enjoy!
